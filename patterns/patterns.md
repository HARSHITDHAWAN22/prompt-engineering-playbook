PROMPT PATTERNS

Prompt patterns are common and proven ways of writing prompts so that AI gives better and more accurate output.

Instead of writing prompts randomly every time, prompt patterns provide a reusable structure that works for many real-world tasks.

You can think of prompt patterns as templates that help you ask questions in a smarter way.


1. SUMMARIZATION PATTERN

- Class or study notes
- Meeting or lecture summaries


2. REASONING PATTERN

This pattern is used when a task requires logical thinking or step-by-step analysis.

Analyze the problem step by step and explain your reasoning.

This pattern helps in:
- Logical questions

3. DATA EXTRACTION PATTERN

This pattern is used when you want specific information from text in a structured format.

Example:
Extract names and dates from the text and return them as a list.

This pattern is useful when:
- Working with raw or unstructured text
- Preparing structured output
- Sending data to other systems
